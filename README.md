# New Kensington Blight Map

This is an interactive map of New Kensington, PA created using Javascript and the Google Maps Javascript API. As of August 2017, it marks examples of blighted buildings near the "Corridor of Innovation" the linchpin of New Kensington's attempts for revitilization. Clicking on Markers will tell you the address of the building, how the parcel is zoned, the owner's name and a little bit of information about plans for demolition if there are any.
